I create software.

## Projects

- *uair* | [GitHub](https://github.com/metent/uair).: An extensible pomodoro timer for UNIX-like operting systems. Although, it is suited for keyboard-oriented workflows, it can even be used with a GUI interface with some configuration. It is lightweight and efficient by relying on concurrency instead of threads.
- *tack* | [GitHub](https://github.com/metent/tack).: A multitree-based heirarchical task manager app written in dart with flutter. Heirarchical task management allows very long tasks to be broken down into smaller and smaller subtasks and hence is also suitable for long-term planning. Multitrees allows two or more tasks to share a single subtask.
- *TinyCPU* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rishbh/tinycpu): This is an attempt at constructing and simulating a very simple 16-bit computer which is inspired by MIPS and Intel 8086 architecture. It has a RISC based instruction set. Simulation is performed on Digital, a digital circuit simulator. Additionally, a custom assembler has been written in Zig language for convenience.
- *SlackOS* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rishbh/slackos): A 64-bit kernel plus bootloader for the x86 architecture. It is written in C and assembly language. Bootloader and ISRs are written in assembly(NASM) and the rest is written in C. A shell has been written for implementing some basic commands.
- *clrdoc* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/twinkletoes123/clrdoc): Simple deep-learning based solution for noise reduction in text-images. It attempts to  remove stains, wrinkles, noise/dirt from the image using an autoencoder neural network built using Rust and tch-rs which is rust bindings for C++ PyTorch api.
- *attoC* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rishbh/attoc): A small compiler written in Rust, consists of lexer, parser, intermediate code generator and a virtual machine. It has zero dependencies and uses recursive descent parser for generating the syntax tree.
- *Ideal Gas Simulation* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rishbh/ideal-gas-simulation): A discrete event simulation simulating ideal gas particles inside a rectangular container. It prints the number of particles in particular speed ranges after simulating for a long time(for particles to achieve equillibrium). This is done to prove the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds.
- *DTU Scraper* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rishbh/dtu-scraper): An application which parses DTU's website and stores it into an sqlite database.
- *shdlr* | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rishbh/shdlr): Time Table Generator using constraint satisfaction algorithm to generate suitable time table. Built using Rust and eframe.
